# PurrPong
🕹Purr Pong is a PC game that is pong but with cute cats! 🐈
I've managed all aspects of the project, from coding and game design to crafting sprites, demonstrating a versatile skill set in bringing creative ideas to fruition. The only component not personally made is the in-game music.

🎮 Will launch the game on my Itch.io very soon.

📄 Updated GDD coming soon too.
